WELCOME TO THE YOURVISION 2022 APP ^^

The application consists of three modules, which you can access using the buttons in the MAIN MENU

NOTEBOOK - allows you to learn the most important information about the songs that participated in the 
        Eurovision Song Contest 2022, additionally contains links to YouTube and Spotify, where you 
        can listen to them

TOP MAKER - here you can rate all the songs (or some of them belong to one of the characteristic groups)
        taking part in Eurovision 2022, create a ranking for them - in the Eurovision community the 
        word top is used

SPOTIFY APP - just like in the TOP MAKER module, you can create a top (ranking) of songs here, but 
        in this case you load songs from your spotify account - the currently listened song is loaded
