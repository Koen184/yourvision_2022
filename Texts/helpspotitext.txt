WELCOME TO THE SPOTIFY APP MODULE ^^

The module allows you to load the currently listened song from Spotify and then add its rating

When you have at least one song rated, buttons are activated that allow you to create a file    
with only the ratings or create a full top (ranking) of songs

The loaded songs have direct titles and a list of artists that are in the Spotify database (Spotify API), 
but the program allows editing for the user's needs (shortening the title, changing artists)

You can interrupt process at any time using the RESET button
All files are saved in the SPOTIFYAPPFILES folder, you can get to it using the button with the folder icon
